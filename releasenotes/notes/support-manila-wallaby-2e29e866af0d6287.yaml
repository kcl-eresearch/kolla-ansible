features:
  - |
    Adds ceph_manila_fs_name variable to support multi-fs Ceph Pacific+ deloyments.
fixes:
  - |
    Removes fix_cephfs_owner yaml which related to pre-wallaby Manila's use of subfolders.
    Post-wallaby Manila now uses cephfs volumes instead, and as such this file is no longer
    required and is causing bugs 1938285 and 1935784
